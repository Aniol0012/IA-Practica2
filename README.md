# IA-Practica-2

## Description

This project, part of the Artificial Intelligence course at [Universitat de 
Lleida](https://udl.cat)), focuses on supervised and unsupervised algorithms. It includes 
implementations and evaluations of decision trees and clustering methods.
Key tasks involve building, pruning, and evaluating decision trees, performance
testing, cross-validation, and various clustering techniques.

For more information check out the [assignment](./Assignment2_IA_22_23.pdf) file.

## Installation
Clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Aniol0012/IA-Practica2.git
```

<!--
## Requirements

The requirements can be found in [requirements](requirements.txt) file. Use this command to install them all:

````shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
-->

## Configuration and Usage

- [`treepredict.py`](./src/treepredict.py): Contains the decision tree algorithms for building and testing trees.
- [`clusters.py`](./src/clusters.py): Implements clustering algorithms.
- [`evaluation.py`](./src/evaluation.py): Utilized for evaluating the performance of the algorithms.
- [`blogdata.txt`](./src/blogdata.txt) & [`blogdata_full.txt`](./src/blogdata_full.txt): Sample datasets for testing.
- [`iris.csv`](./src/iris.csv): Another dataset used for clustering exercises.
